## Project Objective

We've provided a Jupyter notebook that contains the kinds of coding challenges that often come up in data science job interviews. In addition to preparing you for interviews, completing challenges like these is a fun way to develop your Python skills.

## What to Do (and not Do!) if You Are Struggling

These problems may be challenging, especially if you are new to programming. However, they can all be solved in fewer than 15 lines of code using only the types and control flow mechanisms we have covered in class.

Solutions to some of these problems can be found online. If you copy and paste those solutions, two things will happen:

1. You will have missed the point! The types of problems here are meant to display you have a firm grasp on the fundamentals of computer programming. Some of these problems are hard. Youâ€™re meant to struggle!
2. We will report you for plagiarism. Yes, we can tell when you submit work you did not write. We will be forced to give you a make-up (harder) Project 1, and you will be off to a bad start in this class.

There are many better options if you are struggling:

- Work at it for a while, then take a break, let your mind wonder, and come back to the problem with fresh eyes.
- Review the relevant parts of the prework.
- Review the [Python Foundations lesson](https://git.generalassemb.ly/gandenberger-part-time-data-science/python_foundations).
- Check out the additional resources linked in the Python Foundations lesson README.
- Work through the notebooks in the `practice` directory in the Python Foundations lesson repository.
- Come to office hours.
- Post a question on our questions Slack channel.

As a last resort, a partial solution with an explanation of what you did and where you got stuck is better than a flawless solution that isn't yours.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem. Do not include test, practice, or broken code unless you were unable to create a working solution.
3. Comments that explain what your code is doing so that we can understand it and have confidence that you understand it. (Either use the `#` symbol to make comment lines in your Python cells or create Markdown cells.)

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete_
**1** | _Does not meet expectations_
**2** | _Meets expectations_
